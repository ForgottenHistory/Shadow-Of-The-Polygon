Title: **Shadows of the Polygon**

## Game Concept

"Shadows of the Polygon" is a first-person psychological horror game in Unity. It manipulates the familiar, primitive shapes around the player to create an uncanny, ominous atmosphere. The game thrives on unpredictability and suspense, making it a truly immersive and unnerving experience.

## Setting

The game is set in an abstract, otherworldly space filled with eerily unrecognizable environments made entirely from primitive shapes (cubes, spheres, cylinders, etc.). The landscape's appearance varies greatly, from geometric forests to maze-like structures, all adorned with unusual, often shifting patterns of lights and shadows, lending to an oppressive and unsettling atmosphere.

## Gameplay Mechanics

**Movement:** The player can walk, run, crouch, and jump. Standard first-person controls (WASD for movement, mouse for looking around).

**Interaction:** The player can interact with specific elements of the environment (some of the primitive shapes). Interaction can trigger events, like changes in lighting or the environment's configuration.

**Stealth:** Certain sections of the game require the player to avoid detection by threats in the environment. The player can hide behind structures or in shadowy areas to avoid these threats.

**Light Mechanic:** The player possesses a light source (perhaps an orb or a beam) that can manipulate the shapes in the environment, either by altering them, moving them, or revealing hidden pathways. This light source can also unveil hidden messages or hints.

## Objectives

The main objective is to navigate the environment, solving shape-based puzzles and evading threats to progress through the game. The ultimate goal is to escape from this geometric nightmare.

## Art Style

Utilizing Unity's standard render pipeline and shader system, the aesthetic is abstract and minimalistic. Various shaders are used to create dynamic lighting effects that intensify the eerie, unsettling environment. Dark colors, stark contrast, and disorienting, unusual light sources contribute to the unsettling atmosphere. The simplicity of primitive shapes, combined with complex, dynamic lighting, creates an otherworldly feel.

## Sound Design

The sound design is an essential component of the game's horror aspect. A combination of ambient noises, discordant tones, and sudden, unexpected sounds keeps the player on edge. Spatial audio is used to enhance immersion, making sounds appear to come from specific directions.

## User Interface

The UI is minimal to maintain immersion. Essential information is communicated to the player through environmental cues or diegetic elements within the game world itself.

## Unique Selling Points

**Abstract Horror:** Instead of traditional horror tropes, this game uses abstract, unfamiliar environments to unsettle players.

**Dynamic Environment:** The environment is constantly shifting and changing, creating a sense of unease and unpredictability.

**Light-Based Puzzles:** The player's ability to manipulate the environment with light adds a unique twist to the gameplay.

**Sound Design:** Exceptional sound design creates a truly immersive and terrifying experience.
